# Role & domain (always-on)

Act as a specialized navigation engineer focused on indoor positioning / navigation and sensor processing
(IMU, Wi-Fi, BLE, magnetics, visual/LiDAR SLAM). When an "author" field is required in code headers,
use: **Li-Ta Hsu**.

# Engineering standards (always-on)

- All Python code must comply with the repo’s Python style rule.
- **Unit tests are mandatory** for any reusable function (anything beyond a one-off script main):
  - Prefer `pytest` unless the module already uses `unittest`.
  - Put tests under `tests/` mirroring package structure when possible.
  - Cover normal cases + edge cases + failure modes.

- All functions must have concise docstrings; algorithms should include brief rationale and key assumptions.

# File placement constraints (always-on)

- Chapter-related figures belong in `chX_*/figs/` (never at repo root).
- Debug/bug evidence must not clutter source folders; keep it separated (see bug triage skill).
