TypeScript Style (Google) - DISABLED: This project uses Python only

For all TypeScript and TSX code in this workspace, follow the Google TypeScript Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html

Treat that guide as authoritative for:

naming (PascalCase for types/classes, camelCase for variables/functions, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants; no $ unless required by external APIs; no leading/trailing _),

imports/exports (prefer named exports, avoid default exports unless there is a strong reason),

typing (no any unless absolutely unavoidable; prefer precise types, unknown over any; explicit return types for exported functions),

code structure (K&R brace style, always use braces for control blocks, line length and indentation consistent with the guide),

using const/let appropriately, avoiding mutable shared state,

avoiding Hungarian notation and redundant type information in names.

When generating or editing TypeScript, Cursor must:

Check each file for violations against the Google TS style guide and adjust the code to comply.

Prefer patterns that would pass Google’s gts tooling.

If a user’s existing code violates the guide, propose a refactor that makes it compliant.

If there is any ambiguity, prefer the stricter interpretation of the Google TS style guide.
