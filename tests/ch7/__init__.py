"""Integration tests for Chapter 7 SLAM examples.

These tests validate complete SLAM pipelines end-to-end, complementing
the unit tests in tests/core/slam/.

Focus:
    - Scenario-level regression tests
    - Fixed random seeds for reproducibility
    - Threshold-based validation (RMSE, convergence)
    - Full pipeline integration
